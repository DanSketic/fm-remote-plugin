# ðŸ”­ Remote Live Coding

![MadeForGraviton](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Graviton-Code-Editor/website/master/src/badges/made_for_graviton.svg?sanitize=true)

This is a Remote Live Coding plugin for Graviton.

**NOTE**: This is very **experimantal**, unstable, insecure, etc. Still in work in progress.

What you can do for now:
* See who is in the same room as you
* Share folders (bidirectionally)
* See other peer's cursor
* Read and write files
* See how much time you have been coding

Contributions are welcomed!
